## Reporting a Vulnerability

If there are any vulnerabilities in [Z-Shell](https://github.com/z-shell) organization repositories, don't hesitate to _report them_.

1. Use any of the contact options listed on [GitHub organization profile](https://github.com/z-shell).
2. Describe the vulnerability so we can evaluate it faster.
3. If necessary, release a fix or mitigating steps to address it. We will contact you to let you know the outcome and will credit you in the report.
4. You are free to disclose the vulnerability publicly once we have either:
   - published a fix
   - declined to address the vulnerability for whatever reason

> **Note**
>
> - Please **do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** until a fix is released.
> - If you have a fix, that is most welcome -- **please attach or summarize it in your message**!
